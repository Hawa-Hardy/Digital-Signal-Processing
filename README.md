## Overview
This repository contains MATLAB files and exercises focused on understanding the practical applications of DSP. Each lab session addresses different aspects of DSP, such as signal synthesis, filtering, and encoding techniques, providing hands-on experience in manipulating audio signals, compressing data, and processing digital images.

## Topics Covered
- **AM/FM Sinusoidal Signals:** Understanding amplitude and frequency modulation.
- **Music Synthesis:** Creating and analyzing musical notes using synthesized sinusoidal signals.
- **Digital Image Processing:** Exploring analog-to-digital (A/D) and digital-to-analog (D/A) conversion techniques.
- **Sampling, Convolution, and FIR Filtering:** I learnt the fundamentals of sampling and filtering techniques.
- **Frequency Response:** Studying bandpass and nulling filters.
- **Touch-Tone Signal Encoding/Decoding:** Implementing encoding and decoding of DTMF (Dual-tone multi-frequency) signals.
